# particle.js

A particle system designer written in JavaScript using HTML5 Canvas and ExtJS for the UI
  
Still very early (at time of writing, merely days old), stay tuned...

## Features

* Same particle system parameters as Cocos2D and LÖVE
* UI agnostic, the particle system itself has no Ext code in it
* Configurable UI through a query parameter (show only the parameters you care about)

## Future Features?

It'd be cool to export these systems into a Cocos2D or LÖVE format. Also would be cool to export
them into a format that would be compatible with ImpactJS and Cocos2D-JavaScript.
