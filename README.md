A particle system designer written in JavaScript using HTML5 Canvas and dat-gui for the UI
  
![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/city41/particle.js/master/particlejs.png)

## Main Purpose

This particle editor was written to support an article I wrote. The needs of the article came first and so
that does mean particle.js possibly has less than optimal choices for general usage.  
  
It would be nice if particle.js took on a life beyond the article, but in all honesty I have no plans for that
just yet.

## License

Licensed under Apache 2.0. This generally means you can do just about anything you want with this code.
But if unsure, you can read the license here: [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

## Features

* Almost the same particle system parameters as Cocos2D and LÃ–VE
* Mostly UI agnostic, the particle system itself has no dat-gui code in it
  * to be fair: the Emitter has been written with dat-gui-isms in mind.
* Configurable UI through a query parameter (show only the parameters you care about)

## Query Parameters

particle.js's UI is very configurable via query parameters. Here's the low down:

all parameters are optional.

* **w**: integer, width of the canvas in pixels (default is 250)
* **h**: integer, height of the canvas in pixels (default is 300)
* **system**: string, the initial predefined particle system to start out with.
    * choices so far include: `meteor`, `fireworks`, `fire`, `galaxy`, `snow`, `watergeyser` and `ribbon`
    * `ringoffire` is also a choice, see below
* **ui**: string, specifies which UI components to include for alterning the system, see below

### Changing the UI

The **ui** query parameter takes a string that specifies what UI components to include. It's in the form

    <category name>,<parameter name>,<parameter 2 name>:<category name>,<parameter name>,<parameter name>

For example, to have pos, posVar and startColor UI components all in a "Simple" category, the string would be

    ui=Simple,pos,posVar

[like this](http://city41.github.com/particle.js/index.html?ui=Simple,pos,posVar)

(NOTE: when there is only one category, a folder for the category is not created, so you don't see the title of the category anywhere)

Or to have two different categories:

    ui=Basics,pos,posVar,life:Appearance,startColor,endColor

[like this](http://city41.github.com/particle.js/index.html?ui=Basics,pos,posVar,life:Appearance,startColor,endColor)


You can also have no UI at all by specifying [ui=none](http://city41.github.com/particle.js/index.html?ui=none), in this case
you will still get the 'Play' and 'Reset' buttons. 

You can fully hide the UI by hitting 'h', and bring it back with 'h' again

#### All the possible parameters and their UI Types

* **totalParticles** (unsignednumber) total number of particles in the particle pool
* **emissionRate** (unsignednumber) rate at which particles are released
* **pos** `vector` starting position for particles
* **posVar** `vector` variance in particle starting positions
* **gravity** `vector` the gravity vector
* **angle** `number` the angle at which the particles depart, in degrees
* **angleVar** `unsignednumber` variance in the particle angle
* **speed** `number` the speed at which particles move
* **speedVar** `unsignednumber` speed variance
* **life** `number` how long a particle lives, in seconds
* **lifeVar** `unsignednumber` life variance
* **radialAccel** `number` the radial acceleration of a particle. negative values are towards the emitter's location, positive are away
* **radialAccelVar** `unsignednumber` radial acceleration variance
* **tangentialAccel** `number` the tangential acceleration of the particles, perpendicular to the radial acceleration
* **tangentialAccelVar** `unsignednumber` tangential acceleration variance
* **texture** `texture` the texture to use for the particles, UI wise, a file chooser is displayed allowing users to change the texture
* **textureEnabled** `boolean` whether textures are enabled or not
* **textureAdditive** `boolean` whether textures are rendered additively or not
* **radius** `unsignednumber` the radius of a particle if its not using textures
* **radiusVar** `unsignednumber` radius variance
* **startScale** `unsignednumber` the initial scale of a particle if its using textures. from 0 `nothing at all` to 1 `full size of the texture`
* **endScale** `unsignednumber` the final scale of a particle if its using textures. from 0 `nothing at all` to 1 `full size of the texture`
* **startColor** `color` the starting color of a particle
* **startColorVar** `color` starting color variance
* **endColor** `color` the ending color of a particle
* **endColorVar** `color` end color variance

## Ring of Fire particle system

This is a *smidge* hacked in, it was added for the article. To see this particle system, you need to add `transform=true`
and `system=ringoffire` to the query parameters. Like [this](http://city41.github.com/particle.js/index.html?ui=Transform&transform=true&system=ringoffire)

## About datGUI

datGUI is a Google library from the Chrome Experiments team (they are also behind stats.js and three.js). It is the UI library responsible for the
user controls in particle.js.
  
datGUI's main source code home is [here](http://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/). Since it is licensed under Apache-2.0, I decided
to bring my fork of datGUI over here to github (hey datGUI members, if you don't like that, let me know). It is in the `dat-gui` directory.
  
My fork primarily includes two additions:

* FileController -- a controller that allows users to select a file from their file system
* TextAreaController -- like StringController, but users a textarea. 

## And stats.js

particle.js also uses stats.js to display framerate info. I hack it a smidge, and get rid of the realtime graphs after instantiating a `stats` object.
The stats.js library is untouched by me.

## Test Coverage

I know, it's bad. Sorry about that. I promise to come back and flesh out the tests. They are in the `spec` directory and use jasmine.

## Experimental, Import Cocos2D particle plist files

As a first stab at Cocos2D support, I have an experimental branch where you can import plist files for Cocos2D particle systems.

The experiment is running [here](http://city41.github.com/particle.js/exp/)

You can find some sample plist files at the Cocos2D repo [here](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-iphone/tree/master-v2/Resources/Particles)

A few things don't work yet, most notably textures. The textures in the plist are base64 encoded, gzipped TIFFs. I've been able to unwrap and get at them using [gzip-js](https://github.com/beatgammit/gzip-js) and [tiff.js](https://github.com/GPHemsley/tiff-js), which is pretty freakin' sweet if you ask me (the JS community rocks!). But so far the alpha channels appear to not be handled, so I'm looking into adding that to tiff.js. For now, you're probably best off turning off the texture once the plist loads.
